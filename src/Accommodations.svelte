  We'll have hotel blocks at two hotels in Lake Placid (short drive from the venue), and there are also rental properties on the Whiteface Club property and nearby in Lake Placid and the surrounding area.

  Transportation
  </div>
  <div>
  We will hopefully be able to have a bus to transport people from "downtown" Lake Placid to the venue before and after the wedding/reception, which should work for those staying in the hotels and nearby.
